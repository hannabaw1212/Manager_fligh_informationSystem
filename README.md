# Manager_fligh_informationSystem (all based on user story which decribe his requierments) - The code exists in InformationSysAirport.zip

this project focused on modeling and implementing an airline flight management system using Java and UML. The project is based on the following guidelines: 

1. UML Modeling: Created class, sequence, and state diagrams according to the specifications provided.

* Class Diagram: Developed a class diagram that includes interface, logic classes (object control and boundary), and data classes, with a focus on adding a new flight to the system and producing a flight details report by date.
* Sequence Diagram: Created a sequence diagram for the scenario where a flight manager adds a new flight, ensuring the new flight does not conflict with existing flights' departure and arrival times.
* Statechart: Developed a statechart describing flight states depending on the relevant airport states.


2. Java Implementation: Implemented the Java application to support the functionality described in the class diagrams at a prototype level.

* Application Navigation: Emphasized the navigation of the application, functional design of the user interface, and user-friendliness.
* Representative Data: Ensured the presence of representative data in each table.

The project demonstrates the development of an airline flight management system using Java and UML, highlighting the importance of modeling and implementation for efficient system design and operation. The application provides a user-friendly interface and ensures the smooth addition of new flights without conflicts in scheduling.
